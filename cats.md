# Cats

You have to navigate different things to get a cats attention, like looking for figuring in the ground, or using percussion to mutually listen to sounds or smelling plants nearby, usually they will send a spinning bird acknowledgement.  You trace their fur lines with your ears and 
you should feel a line on your ear.
