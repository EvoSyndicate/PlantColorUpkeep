# giraffes

Sometimes giraffes will come in pairs and I try to match the angle of my ears to where they are pointing with their necks.  A little secret, it might be personal, but I try to match the verticle on their sternum with my ears and push to the sides.

I think due to toys r us and things like that, giraffes get locked in 3:00 and you just have to rotate your ears until the it's gone.
