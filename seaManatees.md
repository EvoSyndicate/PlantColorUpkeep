# Sea Manatees

There's a lot of ways to interact with sea manatees, I think they have an extra layer of flesh on them to hurt themselves and show you their injury for a type of animal ministry.
When they suprise you, try clamping your lips together at their arm pit.

I spent a lot of time looking at brass or other construction objects with sea manatees.
