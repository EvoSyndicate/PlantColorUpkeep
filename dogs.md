hyenas use tragus

Dogs use vertebra for astronomy and to monitor tree meristems, first group near the head sets up waypoints, aiming like https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/508440.
Scorched earth.  The second group, stores information and the third group of vertebrae, is a straight up and down vector they aim at stars.  
I have this on my instagram and noted it on meta ai.  People celebrated these technologies just like putting the torilis in the river, but have stopped doing it completely for
100s if not thousands of years now.  There's probably a lot of places like Pangolan and Asean that handle these confusions.  

More specifics, you have to shape your tounge like a bowl and align it with the dogs back and this somehow activates the star vectors.

Sometimes the dog will stiffly wag it's tail to one side, and that is an indication to match their tail with one of your body parts.  It's kind of weird to try to match their tail with your tongue, but that's just something you have to get over lol.
