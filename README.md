## Crate Mertle
shake it and decorate it
mushrooms that were blue on the inside I put on my teeth grew nearby

## Growing alge off of fish scales
I grew some algea from a fish I found on easter and burried it in my backyard.  The cats pulled some scaled up and I put that in a bowl with a magnet in it and it grew some red algae.

## Putting milk on everything
If there's some moss, pour some of the milk you are drinking on it and see what happens.
