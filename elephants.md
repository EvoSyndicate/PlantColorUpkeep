When elephants dig a hole, sometimes they want their cuticles scanned.

Use your ears, pump them out 3 times when the elephant has their ears out and hold them, relax then match their ears.
Sometimes you need to put flowers in the helix of the ear.
Sometimes you can point with a single dot, you should be able to feel this.
Be careful around elephant kids.

Sometimes an elephant does a double yield, you have to match your pupils to their horns.
